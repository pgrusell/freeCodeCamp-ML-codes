# freeCodeCamp-ML-codes

Set of solutions of the proposed exercises of the ML course of freeCodeCamp. 

- Ex0: The idea of this exercise (which is not part of the course) is to build a class to implement a very basic NN and use it on some very basic dataset. In particular, for a given set of points (x, y), we calculate its norm and add some Gaussian noise. The network should be able to predict the correct y out of some (x, y) test samples.
