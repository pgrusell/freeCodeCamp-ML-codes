# freeCodeCamp-ML-codes

Set of solutions of the proposed exercises of the ML course of freeCodeCamp. 

- Ex0: Here we have some "extra" exercises that are not part of the course but have been helpful in order to understand the different topics. In particular:

    - Ex0-1: Presents a problem of regression where we calculate the norm of 2D points plus some background. The NN will learn from them and, given some new 2D points, will try to predict its norm. Here the NN is written entirely from scratch, doing the backpropagation by hand.

    - Ex0-2: This exercise deploys the same dataset as in the previous exercise but now the NN will be implemented using Keras.

    - Ex0-3: Here we will classify the traffic signals of Belgium using a DNN.

    - Ex0-4: In this one, instead of using a DNN, a CNN will be trained on the traffic signals of Belgium and we will see if it achieves a better classification scores.
